Social distancing has made going out very dangerous but we can't put a lockdown on the consumption of food. Just like doctors, farmers work 24/7 minding their fields. 
Our tech solution on using an app on our phone to remotely control and monitor the flow of water via drip irrigation with the help of sensors and IoT will help the 
farmers from directly getting involved in the field. 

Drip irrigation is the most efficient water and nutrient delivery system for growing crops. It delivers water and nutrients directly to the plant roots zone, in the right 
amounts, at the right time, so each plant gets exactly what it needs, when it needs it, to grow optimally. Water and nutrients are delivered across the field in pipes 
called 'dripperlines' featuring smaller units known as 'drippers'. Each dripper emits drops containing water and fertilizers, resulting in the uniform application of 
water and nutrients direct to each plant's root zone, across an entire field.

The above mechanism is directly connected to the app through on the phone with the temperature and humidity data that was stored in the IBM cloud services from the 
sensors, so that farmers can remotely control the flow of water and fertilizers. This can also make farmers be in less contact with the fertilizers. 

This solution brings about efficiency in energy, money and yield. Even though there are many technical breakthroughs everyday. Humans need to go back to their basics, we 
need food to eat and farmers to provide them. So, we believe this technology will help in making their livelihoods better.
